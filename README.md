# Tech Blog CMS: A Full-Stack Blogging Platform

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This is a CMS-style blog application built with Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize. The backend provides RESTful API endpoints to manage blog posts and comments, and uses Handlebars.js for templating. It supports user authentication, allowing developers to create, update, delete, and comment on blog posts. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers for data management, business logic, and presentation, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.
